Design Diary(Imported from written notes from the last couple weeks)

4/1: After my weekly meeting and discussion, I spent time looking at different types
of game design that could be implemented simply using PyGame. I watched lots of videos
that used PyGame to do things like create a space-invaders type simulation, platformers
and even basic RPG's. I considered the idea of creating an inventory system, something 
I'd still like to take on at some point. I decided that doing some sort of a side scrolling
platformer would be a cool mechanic to approach. I downloaded pygame and spent some time
troubleshooting getting the library to load within the IDLE shell of python. 

4/7: Work was done on getting PyGame running, something that ended up taking more time 
than expected due to some installation problems with directory paths. Some good learning
though through it. Started implementing some code after researching some videos with 2D
PyGame examples.

4/9: Managed to get a little Pygame platformer going. Includes a basic character represented
by an image stored within a Renders folder. Using key-button "events" the character could
be moved across the screen using the left and right keys. Pretty cool. This required 
the setting of position of the character within the scene, and the movement of 
that character when a button is pushed. Intriguing to set the frame rate of a game. 
Finally even added a "bouncy" physics to the character, who now sort of jumps around
as you move him. There's a block he can run into, utilizing a simple object-interaction 
code that changes the color of the block when the character touches it.
